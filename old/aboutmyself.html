    <p>
        My name is Prabhab Tiwari and currently reading in Diamond Model School in class 9. I'm passionate about everything in computer, and in the future I expect myself to become a Computer Scientist!
        I was born on 23 december 2006 on Pokhara, Nepal. I was facinated with all the technical device in my childhood. When I was just 7, my grandfather brought me a new desktop. I started to work on different computer programs like Word, Powerpoint, Excel, Photoshop and many oters.

    <h1 class="leftalign">Struggle That I am facing</h1>
    <p> A life of student who have interest in computer field is full of struggle. I had also faced many problems during my journey and learning period. I had low-end pc where programming and other work is very hard to do but i did't lose my hope and continue my learning period.  I always get words from my family beacause in their view i was wasting my time on computer but i didn't care the negative words and today i am infont of you all.
