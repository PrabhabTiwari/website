    <h1 class="leftalign">Who am I<span class="redText"> ? </span> </h1>
  <p>
      My name is Prabhab Tiwari, and I'm a grade 11 student at SOS Hermann Gmeiner School in Gandaki. I have an intense interest in all Computer related stuffs, and I hope to work as a Computer Expert in the future! On December 23, 2006, I was born in Pokhara, Nepal. In my early years, I was fascinated by all the technological gadgets. At the age of seven, my grandfather gave me a brand-new desktop Computer from where I began working with a variety of Computer applications, including Word, Excel, Photoshop, and PowerPoint. 

My interest in technology grew as I worked on it, and I began learning how to code and other fascinating topics from my brother <a href="https://aashishtiwari.com.np/" target="_blank">Ashish Tiwari</a>. At the age of eleven, I practically know many things but there is much more to know about Computers.

  <p> A life of student who have interest in computer field is full of struggle. I had also faced many problems during my journey and learning period. I had low-end pc where programming and other work is very hard to do but i did't lose my hope and continue my learning period.  I always get words from my family beacause in their view i was wasting my time on computer but i didn't care the negative words and today i am infont of you all.
